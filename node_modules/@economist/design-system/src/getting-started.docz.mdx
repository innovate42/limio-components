# The Economist Design System

* NPM module: [@economist/design-system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@economist/design-system)
* GitHub repository: [EconomistDigitalSolutions/design-system](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/design-system)

## About the documentation

The Economist Design System uses [docz](https://www.docz.site/) to generate interactive documentation.

This documentation is automatically updated as part of the design system release process.

## Getting Started

Run `npm run docs` to run the interactive documentation and to preview when developing components in the design system.

Every component should have a [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) file which imports the component, lists defined properties and can be used to describe how and when to use the component.
